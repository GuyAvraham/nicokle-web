The Statement covers the topics below.  If you have additional questions about privacy or information security, please contact us at privacy@prifender.com</p>
                <h5>1.  Types of Personal Information</h5>

Personal Information also includes other information that may be associated with your Personal Information. We may collect the following types of Personal Information:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Contact Information that allows us to communicate with you, such as your name, username, mailing address, telephone numbers, email address or other addresses that allow us to send you messages.</li>

                    </ul>
<h5>2. How Prifender collects Personal Information</h5>
                <p>In many cases, we collect Personal Information directly from you. We will ask you for Personal Information (including Contact Information and Relationship Information) when you interact with us, such as registering on our websites. We may collect additional Relationship Information from third party data suppliers who enhance our files and help us better understand our customers. 
If you interact with us online, we use cookies and other technological tools to collect information about your computer and your use of our website and applications. We treat this information as Personal Information when it is associated with your Contact Information. For more information about cookies and other technologies, please see the section Cookies and Other Data Collection Technologies below. 
</p>
                   
<h5>3. How Prifender uses Personal Information </h5>
                <p>Prifender may use your Personal Information to:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Fulfill your requests for products or services and for related activities, such as product and service delivery, customer service, account management, support and training and to provide other services related to your relationship with Prifender;</li>
                        <li>Provide you with marketing communications and offers for products and services from Prifender and, in some cases, our partners, including offers targeted based on your interests, business characteristics and location;</li>
                        <li>Provide you with additional information that may be of interest, such as Prifender news and announcements and technical service bulletins; and</li>
                        <li>Manage our everyday business needs, such as payment processing and financial account management, product development, contract management, website administration, forum management, fulfillment, analytics, security and fraud prevention, corporate governance, reporting and legal compliance, and business continuity.</li>
                    </ul>

<h5>4. Why Personal Information is disclosed by Prifender </h5>
                <p>Prifender understands that you do not want to us to provide your Personal Information to third parties for their own marketing purposes. We limit our sharing of your Personal Information as follows:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>We may share your Personal Information with our affiliates, which may only use your Personal Information for the purposes listed above. </li>
                        <li>We may also share your Personal Information with our service providers, who are bound by law or contract to protect your Personal Information and only use your Personal Information in accordance with our instructions. </li>
                        <li>We may share your Personal Information with business partners, but only to the extent you have purchased product or service from such partner, interacted with such partner, or otherwise authorized the sharing. For example, if you are referred to Prifender from a business partner website, we may provide that partner with your Contact Information and certain Transactional Information to validate the referral. We may also provide your Contact Information to companies that offer complementary products and services if you request information about these solutions. </li>
                        <li>We may also disclose Personal Information where needed to affect the sale or transfer of business assets, to enforce our rights, protect our property, or protect the rights, property or safety of others, or as needed to support external auditing, compliance and corporate governance functions. </li>
                        <li>We will also always disclose Personal Information when required to do so by law, such as in response to a subpoena, including to law enforcement agencies and courts in the United States and other countries where we operate. </li>
                        <li>Please note that we may also use and disclose information about you that is not personally identifiable. For example, we may publish reports that contain aggregated and statistical data about our clients. These reports do not contain any information that would enable the recipient to contact, locate or identify you. These reports also do not contain any identifiable company information.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h5>5. Cookies and Other Data Collection Technologies</h5>
                        <p>When you visit our website or use our mobile applications, we may collect certain Transaction Information by automated means, using technologies such as cookies, pixel tags, browser analysis tools, server logs and web beacons. </p>
                        <p>For example, when you visit our website, we place cookies on your computer. Cookies are small text files that websites send to your computer or other Internet-connected device to uniquely identify your browser or to store information or settings in your browser. Cookies allow us to recognize you when you return. They also help us provide a customized experience and enable us to detect certain kinds of fraud. In many cases, you can manage cookie preferences and opt-out of having cookies and other data collection technologies used by adjusting the settings on your browser. All browsers are different, so visit the “help” section of your browser to learn about cookie preferences and other privacy settings that may be available. </p>
                        <p>Pixel tags and web beacons are tiny graphic images placed on website pages or in our emails that allow us to determine whether you have performed a specific action. When you access these pages or open or click an email, the pixel tags and web beacons generate a notice of that action. These tools allow us to measure response to our communications and improve our web pages and promotions. </p>
                        <p>We collect many different types of information from cookies and other technologies. For example, we may collect information from the device you use to access our website, your operating system type, browser type, domain, and other system settings, as well as the language your system uses and the country and time zone where your device is located. Our server logs also record the IP address assigned to the device you use to connect to the Internet. An IP address is a unique number that devices use to identify and communicate with each other on the Internet. We may also collect information about the website you were visiting before you came to Prifender and the website you visit after you leave our site. </p>
                        <p>In many cases, the information we collect using cookies and other tools is only used in a non-identifiable way, without any reference to Personal Information. For example, we use information we collect about all website users to optimize our websites and to understand website traffic patterns.  </p>
                        <p>In some cases, we do associate the information we collect using cookies and other technology with your Personal Information. This Privacy Statement applies to the information when we associate it with your Personal Information.  </p>

                        <h5>6. Your Choices </h5>
                        <p>You can always limit the information you provide to Prifender. You can also limit the communications that Prifender sends to you. To opt-out of commercial emails, simply click the link labeled “unsubscribe” at the bottom of any email we send you.  </p>
                        <p>If you have any questions about your choices or if you need any assistance with opting-out, please contact us at Privacy@Prifender.com.</p>

                        <h5>7. Access and Correction  </h5>
                        <p>Prifender respects your right to access and correct your Personal Information. If you have an online account, you can log into your account at any time to access and update the information you have provided to us. Additionally, Prifender complies with all laws regarding access and correction. If you need assistance updating your Personal Information, please contact us at Privacy@Prifender.com.</p>

                        <h5>8. Information Security  </h5>
                        <p>Prifender has implemented an information security program that contains administrative, technical and physical controls that are designed to safeguard your Personal Information. For example, we use industry-standard encryption technology to secure Sensitive Personal Information when it is being collected and transmitted over the Internet as well as firewalls, site monitoring and intrusion detection software. </p>
                        <p>Wherever we collect personal information (such as contact information), that information is encrypted and transmitted to us in a secure way. You can verify this by looking for a closed lock icon at the bottom of your web browser, or looking for "https" at the beginning of the address of the web page.
                        While we use encryption to protect personal information transmitted online, we also protect your information offline. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job are granted access to personally identifiable information. The computers/servers in which we store personally identifiable information are kept in a secure environment.</p>

                        <h5>9. Privacy Policies of Third Parties  </h5>
                        <p>This Privacy Statement only addresses the use and disclosure of information by Prifender. Other websites that may be accessible through this website have their own privacy policies and data collection, use and disclosure practices. Our affiliates, suppliers and business partners have their own privacy policies too. We encourage you to familiarize yourself with the privacy statements provided by all third parties prior to providing them with information or taking advantage of an offer or promotion. </p>

                        <h5>10. Changes to this Privacy Statement  </h5>
                        <p>From time to time, we may update this Privacy Statement to reflect new or different privacy practices. We will place a notice online when we make material changes to this the Privacy Statement. Additionally, if the changes will materially affect the way we use or disclose previously-collected Personal Information, we will notify you about the change by sending a notice to the primary email address associated with your account. </p>
                        <p>Last update:  10 February 2017 </p>
